/// Description: File to record features left to develop
/// and bugs that still need to be fixed
///

[Styling]
- Login screen inputs need to re-worked so icons and text inputs don't get
misaligned.
- NAV logout button will overlap other icons if height of browser is shrinked.

[Core Features]
- Exporting function:
    - Need to be able to create a simple text document for displaying scores,
    grade breakdowns and comments. Needs to be easy to copy text so that it can
    be pasted into myCourses' feedback area
    - Need to be able to make an easily readable spreadsheet to possibly send
    to a professor
    - Will be using Handson table
- Settings page
    - Might be removed
    - Potential Items:
        - Theme changing: Might need to introduce a pre-processor
        - Pinned course sections
- Timestamp table
    - Display this week's time stamps (on both the dashboard home page & timestamp
        specific page)
    - Be able to add/edit/delete a timestamp
    - (Should be already implemented but not sure) Calculating total time spent
    grading
- Creating/Editing/Deleting a Section
    - Currently section id's aren't unique enough. Might need to add term suffix

[Potential Optimizations]
- For Code Cleanliness
    - overhaul current javascript to use module pattern
    - Look for possible simplification of CSS (Consider based on whether or not
    themes will be a feature)
    - Models could be adjusted to not have several getter methods
    - For gradebook/index, consider making a widget/component for the modals
        - Might want to inject them from a separate file so that it's not
        mixed with index file.
- Display of grade table could be optimized to not use 2 sets of nested loops
